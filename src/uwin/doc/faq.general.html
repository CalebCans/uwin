<LI>
What is UWIN?
<P>
UWIN is a UNIX to Windows Integration Toolkit that gives you almost all
the features of a traditional UNIX operating system on Windows NT,
Windows XP, Windows ME, and Windows 95/98.
<P>

<LI>
Why did we write UWIN?
<P>
We needed a UNIX layer to port the AST Toolkit to Windows so
that applications using the AST toolkit would run on Windows platforms
without the need to recode or to support multiple versions of the software.
At the time we started UWIN, there were no alternatives.  Now there
are alternatives such as Cygwin and Unix System Services, but neither
meet our needs as closely as UWIN does.
<P>

<LI>
Which is the latest version of UWIN available?
<P>
Version 4.0 is the latest version of UWIN.
<P>

<LI>
Who are the authors of UWIN?
<P>
Most of the POSIX library was created David Korn, author of the KornShell
at AT&amp;T Laboratories.  Portions of the code were developed under contract
by Wipro, Ltd, in India.  The AST Toolkit which provides most of the UNIX
utilities are part of the AST Toolkit developed primarly by Glenn Fowler,
David Korn, and Phong Vo or AT&amp;T Laboratories.  A few of the utilities
were built from GNU or BSD source code.
<P>

<LI>
Are there separate versions of UWIN for different versions of Windows?
<P>
No, the same UWIN binaries should work with all versions of Windows.
<P>

<LI>
What are the licensing terms for UWIN?
<P>
Starting with release 4.0, most of UWIN base package is available under
the CPL 1.0 license which is an Open Source License approved by the
Open Source consortium.  The vt100 emulator uses an MIT license,
and a few utilities use BSD or GPL licenses.  All of these are
Open Source license.  Earlier versions of UWIN had separate
educational and commercial licenses.
<P>

<LI>
Can closed source applications use UWIN?
<P>
The CPL license does not require you to make your source code available
in order to use CPL software.  The GPL license requires you to make
source code available for any binaries that use GPL code.  As long
as you do not use any GPL code, you can use UWIN without making
your source code available. 
<P>

<LI>
Why is UWIN split into packages?
<P>
The primary reason for splitting into packages was to reduce the
size for users that do not require everyting.  For example, users
that don't do software development do not need the development package.
Not everyone requires the X11, groff,  or perl software either.
The license for these add-on packages might differ depending on where
the sofware has been derived from.  In addition, once the base package
is installed, the installation of other packages can use standard UNIX
tools for installing these additional packages.
<P>

<LI>
What is UWIN Base package?
<P>
UWIN Base package consists of the UWIN runtime libraries, shells,
utilities, daemons and services. It provides a virtual UNIX environment
on Windows.  Most of the utilities were developed by AT&amp;T and conform to
POSIX.2 and X/Open.  A few utilities were compiled from GNU and BSD
source code.
<P>

<LI>
What is UWIN Development pagkage?
<P>
UWIN Development package adds application development support on UWIN.
It consists of header files, libraries and development utilities like cc,
make, rcs, etc. It can be used to build UWIN applications and/or to build
native applications.  The UWIN Development package requires the UWIN base
package to be installed on the system.
<P>

<LI>
What are some other add-on packages?
<P>
The X11 base package provides a number of X11 client applications
as well as an X11 server.  The X11 development package provides
include files and libraries needed to build X11 applications.
The perl package is a compilation of perl 5.8.  The groff package
is a compilation of the GNU groff utilities.
<P>

<LI>
Is UWIN supported?
<P>
Currently UWIN is unsupported.  However since UWIN is used
internally at AT&amp;T, we need to maintain it for internal use.
By providing UWIN under an Open Source license, we are hoping
that some organization(s) will provide support for UWIN.
<P>

<LI>
Where do I report bugs in UWIN?
<P>
There are two mailing groups for UWIN that you can use for this
purpose as well as to get more UWIN information. The
uwin-users@research.att.com group is more general, wherease the
uwin-developers@research.att.com is for users that are developing
applications that run under UWIN.  In addition, problems that
are related to the AST Toolkit, and not UWIN specific, can be
posted on the ast mailing group.  We are happy to receive bug
fixes from users and will merge them into our base software.
<P>

<LI>
Is source code available?
<P>
Yes, the source code as a separate package.  It requires the
version 4.0 or later development kit to build UWIN.  Some
parts of UWIN require the Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler to
build.  The compiler can be downloaded from the Microsoft site.
<P>

<LI>
Does UWIN require the POSIX subsystem on Windows NT or XP?
<P>
No. UWIN does not require POSIX subsystem. UWIN APIs are implemented
using Win32 APIs and therefore interacts only with the WIN32 subsystem
of Windows.
<P>

<LI>
Does UWIN conform to the X/Open standards?
<P>
While UWIN contains nearly all of the X/Open 95 interaces,
UWIN Version 4.0 has not been tested for X/Open Conformance.
<P>

<LI>
Does UWIN handle UNIX permissions?
<P>
UNIX permissions are handled on Windows NT/2000/XP only. The UNIX
permissions are implemented in terms of the NT security permissions.
Administrator has only some of the root privileges. Setuid and setgid
programs can be created for a user provided that UCS for that user is
installed.
<P>

<LI>
Can UWIN handle upper and lower case distinction?
<P>
Case distinction is not handled by default, but any part of the
file system can be mounted as case sensitive both in Windows NT/XP and
Windows 95/98 using loop back mounts.  The performance of the system
might be impacted somewhat and the names for some files might be
different in UWIN than with the native system.
<P>

<LI>
Are UNIX ttys and links supported?
<P>
Yes, but they are not accessible outside UWIN. Hard links are
supported for Windows NT/2000/XP and Windows 95/98 but are accessible
outside UWIN only on Windows/NT NTFS file systems.  Symlinks are
accessible as shortcuts outside of UWIN.
<P>

<LI>
Are tape devices supported?
<P>
Tape devices are supported for Windows NT/2000/XP only. You can use the
tar command to create and restore tape archives.
<P>

<LI>
Are ptys supported?
<P>
Yes. The master pty is /usr/dev/ptym&#0091;0-9A-F&#0093; and the slave pty
is /usr/dev/ptys&#0091;0-9A-F&#0093;.
<P>

<LI>
Does UWIN work with Samba?
<P>
Yes, UWIN will work with the Samba file system but on some versions of
Samba file permissions are not supported.
<P>

<LI>
Is the /proc directory supported?
<P>
Yes, a number of features of the /proc file system are supported by
UWIN.
<P>

<LI>
Can I access "Windows Registry" using UWIN?
<P>
The Windows Registry can be accessed as a virtual file system
that is mounted at /reg from UWIN  Keys that contain subkeys
are directories.  Without a trailing /, each registry key is a
file whose contents are the value of this registry key.
<P>

<LI>
Can I take a binary from UNIX to UWIN.
<P>
No. UWIN does not provide binary level compatibility. But in most
cases the UNIX code can be taken to UWIN and compiled to get a
binary (.exe) working on Windows.
