<B>1) UWIN Client service</B>&nbsp;
<UL>UCS services does not get deleted on uninstallation. When UWIN is installed
in a different directory than the previous installation, and a program
which uses UCS services (typically setuid() program) is run, UCS fails
saying that the file could not be found&nbsp;

<P>Workaround:&nbsp;
<UL>Open UWIN applet from Control Panel->UWIN. Select 'Client' tab. Select
all the lines under 'Installed Clients', check the 'Delete' radio button
and press 'Apply'. Then install the UCS service for the users by running
the below command,&nbsp;
<UL>$ /etc/ucs install &lt;user-account-name> &lt;password></UL>
The other way to get the UCS client installed for a perticular user account
is to telnet into the system as that user or use the UWIN control panel
applet's "Client->Installation Wizard".</UL>
</UL>
<B>2) UWIN and Oracle</B>&nbsp;
<UL>init.exe does not start up on reboot when UWIN and Oracle co-exist
on the same system&nbsp;

<P>Workaround:&nbsp;
<UL>While running UWIN on a machine that has Oracle installed, the UWIN
master service needs to be started before any Oracle services start. Stop
all the Oracle services (from the services applet in control panel) and
start the UWIN master service by doing the following:&nbsp;
<UL>$ net start uwin_ms&nbsp;</UL>
After this, start the Oracle services (from the service applet in control
panel)&nbsp;</UL>
</UL>
<B>3) Screen Saver startup failure</B>&nbsp;
<UL>When the screen saver tries to come up, a message box pops up saying:&nbsp;
<UL>ntvdm.exe - DLL Initialization Failed&nbsp;
<BR>Initialization of the dynamic link library C:\Winnt\system32\user32.dll
failed.&nbsp; The process is terminating abnormally.&nbsp;</UL>
Everything is fine when OK is clicked.&nbsp;

<P>The cause:&nbsp;
<UL>This behaviour is seen when setuid() call is made (doing a rsh/rlogin
to UWIN system, or any application which does a setuid()). To make setuid()
work on WindowsNT (to run applications under different user account at
the same time), a little work-around is required. Once this workaround
is done, the screensaver does not startup properly. This is something to
do with Virtual desktops/workstations in WindowsNT, which are not properly
implemented in WindowsNT 4.0 to handle multi-user conditions. "user32.dll"
fails to startup in this case. This is a OS bug in WindowsNT 4.0, which
should have been taken care by Microsoft. There is no security issue tough,
since the desktop is locked, if the option is selected in the Screen-saver
options. After a system reboot, the initial conditions are resorted, and
screen-saver works fine again (till another call to setuid() is made).</UL>
