<LI>
How much space will UWIN take up on my system?
<P>
UWIN will typically use about 25-30 MB of disc space.
<P>

<LI>
Does it matter whether I install on a FAT partition or an NTFS
partition?
<P>
Some UNIX features will not be available if you install on a FAT
partition.  In particualy, UNIX file permission only work on NTFS
and therefore some commands might not be secure on FAT.
<P>

<LI>
Are the registry keys created for UWIN?  If so, where?
<P>
Yes, registry keys are all created in
<PRE>
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#0092;SOFTWARE&#0092;AT&amp;T Labs&#0092;UWIN&#0092;
</PRE>
Note the the directory that you choose to install UWIN will become
the UWIN_ROOT which is referenced by / from UWIN.  Most of the
entries in the registry can be controlled by the UWIN Applet.
<P>

<LI>
Does it matter what directory I install UWIN in?
<P>
No, it should not matter.  However, you should install it on an
NTFS file system rather than a FAT file system if possible.
<P>

<LI>
What is the UWIN Applet?
<P>
The UWIN applet is a program that is invoked from the Window
Control Panel which can be used to configure UWIN and to stop
and start services.
<P>

<LI>
What is the UMS services?
<P>
On NT/2000/XP UWIN creates a service known as the UWIN Master
Service which should start up whenever you start the system.
This service runs the shell script /etc/rc.  In addition, the Master
Service handles setuid/setgid requests and starts up UCS
servers to run these requests.  
<P>

<LI>
What does /etc/rc do?
<P>
The script /etc/rc is executed when UMS starts up. This script
is used clear out files, run inetd, and start the at/cron daemon.
In addition, you can edit it to start the X11 server or the
ssh daemon.
<P>

<LI>
What is the function of UCS in UWIN?
<P>
A UWIN Client Service (UCS) has to be installed for every user
to whom a setuid() call is to be made. Telnet-ing to a user account
in UWIN, automatically installs a UCS service for that user.
Alternatively, UCS services can be created by the /etc/ucs command
and from the UWIN Applet.
<P>

<LI>
How do I restart UWIN without booting the machine?
<P>
You can do this from the control panel under the master serice tab.
You can stop the UMS service which will kill all UWIN processes and
then restart the service.  Alternatively, the script /etc/stop_uwin
should stop all uwin processes.
<P>

<LI>
Does UWIN log error messages and if so where?
<P>
The following are the list of log files associated with UWIN
processes and services:

<LI>
How can I generate the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files?
<P>
On NT/2000/XP the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files are generated when
the UMS service starts.  They can be regenerated running /etc/mkpasswd.
Note, that the /etc/passwd.add will be prepended so that you can
override generated entries.  On Windows 95/98/ME you need to generate
these manually.
<P>

<LI>
How can I manipulate the maximum values for IPC (inter-process
communication) configurations?
<P>
You can manipulate the IPC values using the System tab in the
UWIN applet and can revert back to default values using the
Restore Default button.
<P>

<LI>
How can I prevent anyone from telnet-ing into my machine?
<P>
You can disable the telent service to prevent anyone from telneting
into the system or you can selectively allow or disallow users by
entries in the files /etc/login.allow and /etc/login.deny.
<P>

<LI>
How do I Enable/Disable the services like ftp, telnet, rlogin and rsh?
<P>
You can edit the /etc/services file directly or you can do this with the
UWIN Applet as follows:
<OL>
<LI>
Open Inetd Tab of the UWIN applet.
<LI>
Double Click on the service name you want to enable/disable or select
the service name and click on Configure button.
<LI>
Check/uncheck the Enable combo box.
<LI>
Click the OK button.
</OL>
<P>

<LI>
Why do I get telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection
refused message when I try to telnet into a UWIN box?
<P>
One of the common reasons why this happens is that the inetd
may not be running on the UWIN host. First check if UMS services is
running on the host machine. If UMS is not running then start
uwin service. This will start inetd by default.
If UMS is already running on the host, start inetd using /etc/inetd &amp;
command from the prompt.
<P>

<LI>
How do I start the ssh daemon?
<P>
After you have done the key setup, you can add /usr/sbin/ssh to
the /etc/profile file.
