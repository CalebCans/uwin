<LI>
How do I get a shell Window?
<P>
Double click on the UWIN desktop icon labled Ksh so start a shell
window.  This will create a console window with a UNIX shell.
<P>

<LI>
How do I name files with UWIN?
<P>
UWIN uses UNIX naming conventions with /
meaning the UWIN_ROOT.  Each drive is mounted under /.
The directories on the filesystem can be accessed using /&lt;drive_letter&gt;.
For example, /c/temp refers to the temp directory on the C drive.
<P>

<LI>
Can I specify environment variables containing path names to be
converted to and from native format like
<STRONG>PATH</STRONG>
is?
<P>
The environment variable <TT>DOSPATHVARS</TT> can be set to a space
separated list of names of additional variables to be converted to
and from native path formats.
<P>

<LI>
Can I access other shared directories from UWIN?
<P>
The directories shared using Windows are automatically mounted by
UWIN. These directories can be accessed in the same way as any other
hard disk on the machine is accessed.
<P>

<LI>
What Shells are available?
<P>
UWIN Version 4.0 has ksh, tcsh and tclsh.
ksh is the latest release of the KornShell(Ksh93). This shell is
also linked to the /bin/sh.
<P>

<LI>
Can I access UWIN from a UNIX workstation?
<P>
UWIN for Windows NT comes with a telnet daemon that allows you
to telnet into a workstation or server.  While all the UWIN commands
run over telnet, some Windows commands only produce output to the
console.
<P>

<LI>
Are the /etc/passwd and /etc/group file available?
<P>
On Windows NT/2000/XP, the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files are
generated by the UMS service on startup based on the Windows
registry.  By default, only local accounts are added.
<P>

<LI>
Does UWIN support crontab entries?
<P>
UWIN supports crontab.
<P>

<LI>
Does UWIN have a ps command?
<P>
Yes, but the ps command does not provide complete information for
native commands.
<P>

<LI>
Can I kill a WIN32 application using "kill" command?
<P>
Along with the UWIN applications, the kill command can terminate
a Win32 process as well. When a UWIN process is killed from the
Win32 environment, certain important clean up functions may not be
performed, resulting in a possible memory leakage.
<P>

<LI>
Can I run a Win32 application from UWIN?
<P>
Yes, Win32 applications can be invoked from UWIN. But the
application name should be in posix format the arguments must be in
the format expected by the program (usually Win32 format).
<P>

<LI>
How can I copy and paste on UWIN console windows?
<P>
UWIN support mouse based copy-paste. Selecting the text using
the left mouse button can do copying and the same can be pasted by
clicking the right button in a two-buttoned mouse or by clicking the
middle button in a three-buttoned mouse.
<P>

<LI>
How do I access Windows Clipboard from UWIN?
<P>
The Windows clipboard can be accessed through /dev/clipboard.
In addition, each time you select a region of text with the mouse from
a UWIN application, the selected region is copied to the Clipboard.
<P>

<LI>
How do I change the title of the ksh window?
<P>
Title for the ksh window, or any console window, can be changed using
the shell function command /usr/fun/title.
<P>

<LI>
How can I control the properties of the UWIN Console?
<P>
It is possible to resize the terminal, change the colors and
scroll back through the previously displayed material. The properties of
the terminal window can be controlled both through the stty command and
by adjusting the Windows properties of the console window.
<P>

<LI>
How do I enable scrolling on a UWIN console window?
<P>
Set the Screen Buffer Size to a larger value than the Window Size
using the control panel.
<P>

<LI>
How do I view man pages on UWIN?
<P>
Man pages can be viewed in three ways.
For most commands, running command --man will generate that man page.
The command man command brings up the man page using groff.  This
requires the groff package.  The html version of man pages can be
viewed using
<STRONG>man -b </STRONG><EM>command</EM>
<P>

<LI>
How can I convert a file in MS-DOS text format to UNIX format?.
<P>
A carriage-return/line-feed marks the end-of-line in a text file
in MS-DOS text format. UNIX systems use the just the line-feed (newline)
character. Most native utilities will accept either format but
some require carriage-return/line-feed.  Many UNIX utilities
will fail if carriage-return/line-feed is used.  The UWIN cat
command has options -t and -T to convert to and from MS-DOS format.
In addition, the UWIN provides the nocrnl utility to convert
carriage-return/line-feeds to line-feeds in text files in place.
<P>

<LI>
How do I run a command like dir which is built into the MS-DOS shell?
<P>
The Windows NT command processor CMD.EXE can be run from ksh,
so CMD.EXE built-in commands can also be run. Assuming that PATH has been
set up to include the Windows NT system directory, UWIN environment could
be set to give the dir command for directory listings.  For example
setting the alias, alias dir='CMD.EXE /c "dir /on"', will allow
the native dir command to be used in ksh.
<P>

<LI>
How can I set the home directory for an user?
<P>
Home directory for an user should be set through NT user manager.
Absolute path should be given for the User Profile Path field of the
Users profile.
<P>

<LI>
How are pid's assigned to UWIN processes on NT|2000|XP?
<P>
The pid for an UWIN process will will be contructed from
the Windows pid unless the process has been created by exec.
The value is obtained by multiplying by 32 and then adding a number
from 0-31.
<P>

<LI>
How are pid's assigned to UWIN processes on 9X|ME?
<P>
On Windows 9X, the pid is a huge value and hence becomes negative
when converted to pid_t type. UWIN has a way of mapping the actual id
with the one that is returned by getpid() function.
<P>

<LI>
How are user ids and group ids assigned in UWIN?
<P>
UWIN maintains a table of subject identifier prefixes, and constructs
the user id and group id by a combination of the index in this table
and the last component of the subject identifier. The number of subject
identifier prefixes that are likely to be encountered on a given machine
is much smaller than the number of accounts so that this table is easier
to maintain.  The subject identifier prefix for the local system is 0
so that local accounts have small ids.  The local adminstrator id is 0
and the local system account is mapped to group 1.
