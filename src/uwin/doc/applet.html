<TD>UWIN comes with a control panel appet (accessed throught 'Start->Settings->Control
Panel->UWIN') which can be used to configure some of the UWIN system parameters.
The applet has different categories which is described in detail below.&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
<B>General</B></LI>

<BR>Under this category, the user can get more information about the Windows
platform on which UWIN is installed. Details regarding the version of UWIN
being run is also available.&nbsp;
<BR>Apart from this the user can view to whom UWIN has been register along
with the license key used during installation. For evaluation copy, the
registered user will be "AT&amp;T Evaluation Copy" and the licence key
will be "uwin_eval".&nbsp;
<BR>There is an option of controlling the logging level in /tmp/uwin_log.
Right now the only option available is "Log Errors" where the logs will
be generated by default. The option of diabling the logging and providing
more logging to enable tracing will be provided in later versions of UWIN.&nbsp;
<BR>User can have different versions of UWIN (1.6x or 2.0) installed on
the same system and switch between them using the "Installed Version in
use" option.&nbsp;
<BR>Information about commercial vendors of UWIN can be obtained by clicking
on the "Commercial Information" button.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>System</B></LI>

<BR>This category helps the user to configure some of the limits that UWIN
imposes. The different categories whose limits can be configured are message
queues, resources, semaphores, and shared memory.&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Master</B></LI>

<BR>Here the UWIN Master Service can be configured appropriately. Apart
from showing the current status of the service, the type of startup can
also be specified. The service can also be stopped, deleted, installed,
or started.&nbsp;
<BR>When the check box "Setuid Support" is unchecked, any file which has
the s-bit set does not work when executed. This way, administrators can
have one more level of security.&nbsp;
<BR>When the check box "Domain Accounts Enumeration" is unchecked, the
domain account will not be enumerated into the /etc/passwd file. Only the
local machine accounts will be enumerated. This is useful for users who
are on a huge network where the enumeration of domain accounts take too
much of network bandwidth. However, diabling of this option does not affect
with the domain support of UWIN.&nbsp;
<BR>The option "Reuse passwd.add &amp; group.add" when checked will facilitate
in appending the contents of /etc/passwd.add into /etc/passwd and /etc/group.add
into /etc/group automatically. However, the user is responsible for the
validity of the contents in /etc/passwd.add and /etc/group.add since no
check is made before appending them to /etc/passwd or /etc/group files
respectively.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Inetd</B></LI>

<BR>This lists some of the inet daemons that can be configured using the
UWIN applet. Selecting any one service and clicking on 'Configure' will
enable users to configure that perticular service. The service can be enabled/disabled,
the port number at which the service listens can be changed. However, it
is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the port he/she gives
does not clash with any existing services. This can be checked by viewing
the file /etc/services and giving the port number that is not listed in
it.
<BR>If the user is interested in configuring other daemons that are not
listed here or other options that are not provided in the configure dialog
box, the /etc/inetd.conf file needs to be edited and changed manually.
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
<B>Client</B></LI>

<BR>This category enables a user to manage the UWIN Client Services (UCS).
The accounts under which the service is installed is listed here. Apart
from displaying the properties of the services, the user can delete services
by selecting the ones to be deleted, checking the radio button 'Delete',
and clicking on the 'Apply' button.&nbsp;
<BR>There is also an installation wizard using which services for particular
account can be installed. To install UCS under a particular account, the
user needs to select the account by expanding the tree, type the password,
and then click on 'Install' button.</UL>
