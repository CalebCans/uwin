.H 1 "What is UWIN?"
.P
UWIN provides a UNIX like interface to a Windows XP, Windows NT, Windows 95,
and Windows 98 system.  Its goal is not to provide a bridge
to help you move to a Windows system, but rather as a safety net
and security blanket for you to use on Windows systems that
will enable you to survive without getting locked in.
UWIN was designed by me for me.

If you are looking for a UNIX system, you might do better
getting a native UNIX system such as Linux, BSD, SCO, or Solaris.
However, if you are a UNIX user that has a need to use a UNIX
system or to get a UNIX application working on a Windows system,
then UWIN is for you.  In addition, if you are a Windows user
and want to get your feet wet with UNIX, learn something about
using UNIX tools, then UWIN is for you.  It might provide
a bridge out of the rigid world of Windows.
.P
UWIN was designed to make UNIX users feel at home rather than
having to learn a new set of conventions.  There is very
little a UNIX user needs to know to use UWIN as a pure UNIX
environment.  However,  most users will not be using UWIN
is a pure UNIX environment.  They are likely to have to
use native Windows applications or interact Windows specific
development tools or facilities.  UWIN was designed to
make this as natural as possible with as few restrictions
as possible.
.P
UWIN is not a separate subsystem.  UWIN applications are native
applications that run at full speed.  Because it is not
a separate subsystem, you can write applications that
make UNIX system calls and WIN32 application calls in the
same process.  On the other hand,  UWIN contains a few
extensions that reduces the need make the need to make WIN32 API calls.
