sear *.files entries
--------------------

each entry is a / relative path of files to be packaged
symlinks just include the symlink and not the link target
directories name themselves and recursively all contents
in general omitting directories and spelling out each file is preferable

entries of the form
	to::from
map the local system physical path "from" to the package path "to"

entries of the form
	to::
delete the file "to" on the system that unpackages the sear

the local system files are viewpathed relative to $INSTALLROOT
with "/" used as a last resort; e.g., the uwin posix headers are typically
packaged from /usr/include rather than a viewpathed build directory
