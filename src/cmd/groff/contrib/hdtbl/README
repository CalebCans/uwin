Preparing the use of hdtbl:
---------------------------

For an easy use of the hdtbl macros you can copy the macro files
`hdtbl.tmac´ and `hdmisc.tmac´ in the directory `site-tmac´ of groff, 
typical in `/usr/share/groff´ or `/usr/local/share/groff´. 
A place for the man page `groff_hdtbl.7´ could be `/usr/man/man7´,
`/usr/share/man/man7´ or `/usr/local/man/man7´.

Now you can call `groff -m hdtbl ...´ and `man groff_hdtbl´.
If you don't have access to the `site-tmac´ directory you can put 
`hdtbl.tmac´ and `hdmisc.tmac´ into a private macro directory `xyz´
and reference this with the aditional flag `-`M xyz´ when calling groff. 

If you like to use hdtbl in conjunction with another macro package,
e.g. ms, say `groff -m ms ...´ and in your document `.mso hdtbl.tmac´.
To get the behaviour, that a table, which does not fit on a partially
filled page, will be printed automatically on the top of the next page
you must append the little hdtbl utility macro `t*hm´to the page header
macro of the other macro package, e.g. for the ms macros:

	.am pg@top \"	the ms pageheader macro
	.t*hm
	..

hdtbl has builtin pageheader- and pagebottom makros HM and BM. If they
interfere with your own, replace them with `.rm HM´ and `.rm BM´.
 
You can change the default settings for hdtbl and the builtin pageheader
and -bottom macros by overwriting the corresponding registers and strings
at the beginning of file `hdtbl.tmac´.

HDtbl is clean groff, but some of the examples and additional macros
in `hdmisc.tmac´ necessary for some examples use system requests via 
`.sy´ and `.pso´. This requires a) to call groff with the `-U´ flag and 
b) to provide for Windows an Unix environment like Cygwin or MinGW.

To Do:
------

* Macro TOTC (Table Of Table Captions).

* Automatic recognition of the number of columns.

* Optional automatic calculation of the cellwidths from the widths of
  the first line of the cellcontent instead of the explicit
  specification with the width argument. This seems to be nontrivial
  without a preprocessor or additional external calls vial .sy or .pso.

* Handling of pagebreaks in tables.

* Floating text left and/or right from tables.

* Converter hdtbl2html (awk, elisp, perl?); should be easy to write.

* Support for nroff. 

Enjoy with hdtbl!
